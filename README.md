# Number Guessing
In this project, the computer thinks a number and we have to predict that number. If we predict smaller number, the system will show "Smaller Number, Think Again!!!" and if we think a higher number, the system will show "Greater Number, Think Again!!!". At the end we predict the number, then system will show
"Congratulations, You Won!" with the "number of attemps" we took to predict the number.
This is the link for that repository.
